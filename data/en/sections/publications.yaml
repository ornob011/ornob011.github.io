  paper:
    summary: A few-shot learning model was developed for the early detection of COVID-19 using CT scan images. The model achieved high accuracy with only 200 CT scans per category for training data. It combines few-shot learning with an ensemble of pre-trained convolutional neural networks to classify CT scan images into Normal, COVID-19, and Community-Acquired Pneumonia categories. The proposed model achieved impressive results, with 98.719% overall accuracy, 99.36% specificity, 98.72% sensitivity, and a 99.9% ROC score, tested on a dataset of 10152 CT scans.

  paper:
    summary: Skull fracture classification is a difficult and time-consuming process, and fractures at multiple sites make it harder to detect fracture types. To automate this process, a new model called SkullNetV1 was proposed, which uses a convolutional neural network for feature extraction and a lazy learning approach for classification of skull fractures from brain CT images into five fracture types. The model achieved a subset accuracy of 88%, an F1 score of 93%, an AUC of 0.89 to 0.98, a Hamming score of 92%, and a Hamming loss of 0.04 for a seven-class multi-labeled classification.

  paper:
    summary: A computer-assisted expert system was developed to classify skull fractures from CT scans using ResNet50 for feature extraction and a gradient boosted decision tree algorithm for classification. The model achieved an overall F1-score of 96%, making it an accurate tool for assisting physicians with skull fracture diagnosis.
